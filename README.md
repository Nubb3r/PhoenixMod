5. Find the new shortcut on your desktop, right click on it, and in the field "Target" add "-mod phoenixmod -dev" to the end of the line with a space after the quotes. 
   I have also added some other stuff. Here are my launch options if you are interested:
   -mod phoenixmod -dev -nomovies -window -fullwindow -forceactive -lockMouse -novsync -notriplebuffer -refresh 144

6. Done! Now you can start the game with the mod by using the new shortcut on your desktop


Each time there is a new version, you need to delete the files you have copied from the ZIP files to the CoH directory and repeat steps 1-4

# GridKeys
You can use gridkeys in the following manner:

1. If you don't already have the WW2Data_KeyDefaults.sga in your "Company of Heroes Relaunch\WW2\Archives" directory,
   download it from [here](https://github.com/Nubb3r/PhoenixMod/files/8417378/WW2Data_KeyDefaults.zip) (or [here](https://github.com/Nubb3r/PhoenixMod/files/8417617/WW2Data_KeyDefaults_de.zip) for german keyboard layout) and put it there:

2. Go into the PhoenixMod.module in the main CoH directory and delete the semicolon in line 46. You will have to do this each time you redownload/update the Mod
