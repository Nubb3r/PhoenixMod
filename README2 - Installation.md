## Installation (including GridKeys instructions at the end). 

0. Uninstall any skin/sound packs, because they have caused many problems until now. There is a long term fix planned.
---
1. Click on releases and select the LATEST available version.

3. Find your main CoH directory ("Company of Heroes Relaunch") by going to the Steam Library, right clicking on CoH, and selecting "properties"

4. After selecting "properties", a new window will open, where you click on "installed files" and then onto "browse". Now, a new window opens. This is the main directory of your CoH installation.

---
5. Put the ZIP file into this directory directly and right click it and select "extract all". If Windows asks you to replace things now, it means you have had a previous installation of PhoenixMod. In this case, to be safe, stop and delete all PhoenixMod files (except the ZIP) from your CoH main folder, and repeat this step.

6. After you clicked "extract all", a new window opens, where you need to delete the highlighted segment, and confirm.

7. Find your RelicCoH.exe in your main CoH directory, right click on it, and select "send to desktop"

---
8. Find the new shortcut on your desktop, right click -> "properties". A new window opens.<br>
In this new window, go to "Target" (or "Ziel" in German) and add<br>
-mod phoenixmod -dev<br>
with a space after the quotes.

---
9. Done! Now you can start the game with the mod by using the new shortcut on your desktop. <br>
Each time there is a new version, you need to delete all the PhoenixMod files from the CoH directory and repeat steps 1-6. <br>
You can conveniently delete everything by double clicking the "!PhoenixMod_Uninstaller.bat" file located in your CoH Relaunch folder.

# GridKeys
You can use gridkeys in the following manner:

1. If you don't already have the WW2Data_KeyDefaults.sga in your "Company of Heroes Relaunch\WW2\Archives" directory,
   download it from [here](https://github.com/Nubb3r/PhoenixMod/files/8417378/WW2Data_KeyDefaults.zip) (or [here](https://github.com/Nubb3r/PhoenixMod/files/8417617/WW2Data_KeyDefaults_de.zip) for german keyboard layout) and put it there:

---
2. Go into the PhoenixMod.module in the main CoH directory and delete the semicolon in line 46. You will have to do this each time you redownload/update the Mod.
