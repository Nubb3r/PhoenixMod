## Updating PhoenixMod to a new version

When updating your PhoenixMod to a new version, you have to delete all the old files first.

These files include:
- "PhoenixMod" folder
- PhoenixMod.module
- PhoenixModDLC1.module
- PhoenixModDLC2.module
- PhoenixModDLC3.module
- PhoenixModOps.module

You can do this manually, or simply by double clicking the "!PhoenixMod_Uninstaller.bat", located in "Company of Heroes Relaunch".<br>

This batch script automatically deletes all the PhoenixMod files for you.

You will now have to follow the normal install instructions, but you don't have to make a new desktop shortcut. Just keep using the one you already have.
