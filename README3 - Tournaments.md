# Conducting matches

##  Group phase process (BO2 on one map)
1. Coin flip (loser gets first+last veto and position for first game)
2. Loser of coinflip vetos a map
3. Winner of coinflip vetos two maps
4. Loser of coinflip vetos a map (leaving only one map, which will be played)
7. Winner of coinflip picks faction
8. Loser of coinflip picks position
9. Each match consists of 2 games on the selected map <br>After the first game, players swap positions+teams and play again
- Scoreline of 2-0 means -> 3 points for winner
- Scoreline of 1-1 means -> 1 point for each player
- Top 2 of each group advance to next phase, while bottom 2 are eliminated
- If 2 players are tied in points, their direct matchup will count
- If their direct matchup is 1-1, their win/lose ratio will count
- If win/lose ratio is the same, they will play a single decider game, I will organize it if this really happens
