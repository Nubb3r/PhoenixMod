8. Each match consists of 2 games on the selected map. After the first game, players swap positions+teams and play again

- If 2 players are tied in points, their direct matchup will count
- If their direct matchup is 1-1, their win/lose ratio will count
- If win/lose ratio is the same, they will play a single decider game, I will organize it if this really happens
