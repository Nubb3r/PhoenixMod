# Tournaments
There is an active tournament right now!

## 2nd PhoenixMod Tournament (1v1, Fall 2024)
- Patch: https://github.com/Nubb3r/PhoenixMod/releases/tag/0.32
- Format: Group phase BO2 + Double Elimination phase BO3 + Grand Final BO5
- Phases: Pre Preperation -> Registration -> Final Preparation (CURRENT) -> Group Phase -> Elimination Phase -> Grand Final -> Recap
"- Coordination: Players schedule their matches freely during each week. All communication is encouraged to be done in the respective discord channels.
If a player commits to a date/time and doesn't show up he will auto lose unless his opponent gives him another chance.
If players can't agree on a date/time, they will have to show up for the final check-in on Sunday between 19:00 an 22:59 (UTC+2) time and bring enough time to play their match.
Whoever doesn't show up auto loses. If neither player shows up, they both auto lose. This is just necessary to keep the timeline reasonable."
"- Timeline: Start is Monday, October 21st. Duration depends a bit. Pace is one match per week per player, enforced by the final check-ins (see discord).
Lower Bracket matches need to be played ASAP however, to keep overall duration reasonable. I will help schedule these individually. You can think of this as an extra handicap for dropping from upper bracket."
- All games will be casted live on: https://www.twitch.tv/nubb3r
- All casts will be uploaded on: https://www.youtube.com/@nubb3r918/videos in it's own playlist (link will follow soon)

# Verifying matches
- Record and upload a video or screenshot of the game (screenshots preferably over opponent base at game start)
- Not providing this is grounds for auto loss
- No livestreaming allowed because of spoilers and impossibly annoying cheating allegations

# Crashes and restarts
- If a player crashes, the game will be replayed. This will be handled individually and under extreme scrutiny.

# Replays
- Winner sends the replay to me in DMs on discord
- Please give the replays good names, both in-game, but also the files in the playback folder before sending
- Ideally, it would follow the following format: "PMT2-GrpD-R2-M2-G1" (this means "PhoenixMod tourney 2, Group D, Round 2, Match 2, Game 1)
